## <b>Contributing to AUTODEL</b>

`AUTODEL` uses `Tkinter` for UI development and `PIL` for some other functionalities. You can contribute in many ways, from reporting bugs to adding features that you find suitable. Some ideas to contribute have been listed below.




## UI improvement.

### Difficulty: Easy

### Description: 

You can improve the UI and add a `Report for Bugs` link in the status bar. 



 ## Make it compatible with LINUX

### Difficulty: Easy – Medium

### Description:

So far `AUTODEL` works on `WINDOWS OS` only. With some improvement you can make it compatible with other OS as well. All you need is to check the OS beforehand and  use the folder path format accordingly as `WINDOWS` and `LINUX` uses different folder formats.



## Ask for confirmation in the last step

### Difficulty: Easy – Medium

### Description: 

Once the user clicks on ` Delete Files!` button you need to provide a confirmation step to the user and then take decisions accordingly(whether to delete the files or not)



## Improve Performance!

### Difficulty: Medium – Hard 

### Description:

The logic implementation or the coding part has been done in a layman way. Though the performance measure is fine but you can use various tools like `Generators`,  `numpy arrays`, etc., to improve the performance.
